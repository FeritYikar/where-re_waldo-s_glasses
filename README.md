Project idea 1
Where's Waldo?
An app that will help you find things at home.

<img src='lost.png' width=80%>

An image classification project that we classify objects that go missing the most like remote controller, glasses, keys, phones on silent :) 

For data I will have many pictures of items that get lost frequently. 


This project then can be expanded in an app that will help you find stuff you lost using phones camera

It is important that algorithm will be able to spot an object from all angels and even if it sees a small proportion of it buried in the couch.

Trying to guess the formula 1 winner

Formula one 2022 schedule is up and we know (if there are no last minute changes) where each race will be held and when. In motor sports different tracks have different characteristics and different cars/drivers have advantage on different environments. By looking at the databases from previous years I will try to understand who is more likely to win each of these races and try to determine who would be the winner of F1 2022.(Verstappen I believe :))

Project idea 3

Make Manchester United great again. 

ManU, one of the greatest teams of all time has been struggling for some time to achieve desired success. They have great fanbase and money yet they cannot sign good deals. They have spent a lot f money lately but fallen behind Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City in the Premier League, also no success in Europe for a long time as well. What if we applied a model similar to Moneyball. I believe Manu has been spending a lot of money just to please fans but their transfer policy have not worked yet, therefore maybe a new generation of young promising players like Sir Alex Ferguson built, can help the team to reach back to glory.

For data I will do some web scraping from football stats and transfer market websites.
